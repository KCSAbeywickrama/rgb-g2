**LEN1093 Laboratory Practice - I : RGB Color Sensor Project**

A colour sensing device is made using the RGB model approach. This device has three operational modes. Calibration mode, Sensor mode and Given value RGB mode. The calibration mode is to calibrate the device before the test run and this is done in real-time using only three colours. The goal of the Sensor mode is to identify the red, green, blue content in the colour of a given surface and display them using an LCD. In given value RGB mode
a keypad is used to get user inputs and light is illuminated according to those inputs. This colour sensor is developed without using any third-party libraries and only using one PWM pin in the microcontroller to control an RGB LED. We explored different algorithms to achieve high accuracy and finally ended up with a simple endpoint method algorithm. An end product is made including the custom PCB design and a user-friendly 3D enclosure.
